// 1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions


// (function(){
//   var a = b = 3;
// })();
// console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
// console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));



// 2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27

function createBase(number) {
    let baseNumber = 6;

    function addSix(number) {
        return baseNumber + number;
    }

    console.log(addSix(10));

}

function createBase(base) {

    return function(number) {
        return number + base;
    }
    // return (number) => base + number
}

//const createBase = base => number => number + base

// => function
const joinString = base => string => base + string


console.log(joinString)
const sayHello = joinString('Hello, my name is ')
console.log(sayHello)

console.log(sayHello("Mark"))
console.log(sayHello("Tim"))
console.log(sayHello("Tim"))




const addSix = createBase(6);
console.log(addSix(10));


// 3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
